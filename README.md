codebook.md
run_analysis.R
tidy.txt

Raw data is from
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

codebook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R aims to do the following
-Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
-Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
-Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
-Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
-Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

tidy.txt is the resulted tidy data
